      <h1>Creating groupings (placing students into seats)</h1>

      <p class="summary">
        Creating groupings is when you and ClassSeats actually place students into seats.
        Using your seating arrangement as a template, ClassSeats generates a starting seating chart
        that you can adjust as needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Think of groupings as <strong>“today’s seating”</strong>, built on top of your room setup.
      </p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Step 1: Go to the Groupings tab and select your class</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>Open the <strong>Groupings</strong> tab.</li>
          <li>Under <strong>Select Class Period</strong>, choose the class you want to work with.</li>
        </ol>

        <!-- MEDIA (required): Screenshot showing the Groupings tab with the class selector and Group Configuration visible. -->
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Step 2: Choose how groups should be created</h2>

        <p>
          ClassSeats gives you several ways to create groups. For most teachers, the simplest option
          is to use the seating arrangement you already set up.
        </p>

        <p>To do this:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Select <strong>Use Seating Arrangement</strong>.</li>
          <li>Choose the seating arrangement you want to use from the dropdown.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          This tells ClassSeats to create one group per table, using the table capacities you defined earlier.
        </p>

        <!-- MEDIA (required): Screenshot showing “Use Seating Arrangement” selected with an active seating arrangement chosen. -->
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Step 3: Generate groups</h2>

        <p>Once your options are set:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>(Optional)</em> Leave <strong>Balance by Gender</strong> checked if you want ClassSeats to try
            to create more balanced groups when possible (for example, avoiding one student being placed
            with a group of all students of another gender).
          </li>
          <li>Click <strong>Generate Groups</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          ClassSeats will generate a set of groups based on your seating arrangement and display the results.
        </p>

        <!-- MEDIA (required): Screenshot of the Grouping Results view showing multiple tables with students assigned. -->
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Step 4: Adjust groups manually (optional but common)</h2>

        <p>
          The generated groups are a <strong>starting point</strong>, not a final answer.
          Use your professional judgment to tweak the results.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can manually adjust groups by clicking and dragging students between tables.
        </p>

        <h3>Moving students between groups</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Click and drag a student from one table to another to move them.</li>
          <li>Each table has a maximum capacity based on your seating arrangement.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If a table is already full, you’ll see a message letting you know.
        </p>

        <!-- MEDIA: Screenshot of the “Table is full” message. -->

        <h3>Unassigning a student</h3>

        <p>If you want to move a student into a full table:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Hover over a student’s card in a group.</li>
          <li>Click <strong>Unassign</strong>.</li>
          <li>The student will move to the <strong>Unassigned Students</strong> tray at the bottom of the screen.</li>
          <li>Drag the student from the unassigned tray into the group you want.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          This gives you full control over the final grouping.
        </p>

        -->
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Step 5: Save the grouping</h2>

        <p>Once you’re happy with the groups:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Click <strong>Save Grouping</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Your grouping is now saved and can be used for seating charts, attendance, notes, and reports.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can regenerate or change groupings at any time—nothing is permanent.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>What happens next</h2>

        <p>After creating a grouping, most teachers do one of the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>View the seating chart</li>
          <li>Take attendance</li>
          <li>Start class and make quick notes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If you want more control over how groups are generated—such as keeping certain students together
          or apart—you can explore advanced grouping options later.
        </p>

      <div class="tip">
        <strong>Tip</strong>
        Don’t aim for perfection on your first grouping. Most teachers generate groups,
        make a few manual tweaks, and move on.
